PLEASE follow the below steps to contribute.

Making a pull request (PR) for open source contributions involves several steps. Here’s a concise guide to help you through the process:

### 1. **Find a Project**
   - Look for open source projects on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket that match your interests or skills. Websites like [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) and [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) can help.

### 2. **Fork the Repository**
   - On the project’s GitHub page, click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 3. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd repo-name
     ```

### 4. **Create a New Branch**
   - It’s best practice to create a new branch for your changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch-name
     ```

### 5. **Make Changes**
   - Edit the files or add new features. Make sure to follow the project's coding guidelines.

### 6. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Stage your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit with a clear message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Description of the changes made"
     ```

### 7. **Push Changes to GitHub**
   - Push your branch to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch-name
     ```

### 8. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to the original repository where you want to contribute.
   - Click on the "Pull Requests" tab and then "New Pull Request."
   - Select your branch and compare it with the base branch (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Add a title and description for your PR, explaining the changes and why they are needed.

### 9. **Address Feedback**
   - Once your PR is submitted, maintainers might review it and provide feedback. Be open to suggestions and make any necessary changes.
   - If you need to make changes, do so in your local branch, commit, and push again to update the PR.

### 10. **Stay Engaged**
   - Respond to any comments or questions from maintainers. Thank them for their feedback and be willing to collaborate.

### 11. **Merge Your Pull Request**
   - Once approved, either the project maintainer will merge your PR or you might be given permissions to do so, depending on the project’s guidelines.

### Tips
- Always read the project’s CONTRIBUTING.md file if available; it often contains specific instructions.
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting.
- Be respectful and patient; maintainers may have busy schedules.

Good luck with your contribution!
